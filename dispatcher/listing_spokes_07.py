    Wired for real 2026-07-17 (owner decision, not left as documentation-
    only): transaction milestone data (which milestones need a document
    request, which need vendor scheduling and what kind) used to be two
    independent hardcoded structures here plus a THIRD independent
    hardcoded reverse-mapping in the vendor.cancellation_notice handler -
    three copies of overlapping facts that could silently drift from each
    other. Now one constructor parameter (transaction_milestone_config),
    genuinely single-sourced; kind_to_milestone() derives the reverse
    mapping from it rather than duplicating it. Default reproduces the
    prior hardcoded values exactly - every existing test passes
    unmodified. Deliberately NOT covered: the per-milestone business logic
    in doc.status handling (inspection/appraisal/title/earnest_money/
    closing) and the financing_contingency deadline-alert case - those are
    genuinely distinct logic per milestone, not lookup data, and making
    them "configurable" would mean inventing a rules engine and guessing
    at business logic that isn't this review's to invent.
