    """DECISIONS.md tuples implemented directly:
      1. comps come back thin -> report the thinness, never widen params silently
      2. sources conflict on a datum -> present both with provenance, never
         average. Fixed 2026-07-16: only implemented for comps (tuple 9's
         sold-price case) - neighborhood packages had no way to even
         represent a second conflicting source for one figure (schema was
         one value per key). Now accepts either a single source dict or a
         list of them per figure; a list with disagreeing values is
         reported as a conflict, never averaged or silently narrowed to one.
      3. anyone asks for the opinion -> refuse, data only; escalate if pressed
      4. staleness threshold reached -> regenerate, never reship. Fixed
         2026-07-16: only implemented for comps - neighborhood packages had
         no staleness check at all, so a 3-year-old crime stat would ship
         with no flag. Now checked the same way comps are.
      5. license limits the recipient -> deliver to human only + note limit
      6. scrape source blocks/changes terms -> stop that source, log raw
         error, never route around. NOT implemented - this requires a
         real scraping subsystem with per-source state (what's blocked,
         when, why) that doesn't exist anywhere in this codebase. Same
         class of gap as Agent 05's syndication tuples: honestly flagged
         as structurally unbuilt, not stubbed to look done.
      7. datum lacks timestamp/source -> does not enter any package
      8. comp set thinner than rubric minimum -> deliver with thinness
         named, never padded
      9. two sources disagree on sold price -> report both with sources,
         never pick silently
      10. request smells like appraisal substitution -> data package with
          not-an-appraisal note, 17 informed. Fixed 2026-07-16: the smell
          check was computed once but only ever passed to the comp-mode
          builder - a neighborhood-mode request with the same phrasing
          ("what's this area actually worth instead of an appraisal")
          never triggered the note or the 17 notification.
      11. historic data beyond retention -> absent is the answer, never
          reconstruct from memory

    Structural gap, not fixed here (found during review 2026-07-16):
    self.mls_feed accumulates listing.data from 05, but nothing ever reads
    it - genuinely dead state, not just an oversight. Job Component #1
    says comps are "pulled from MLS via 05 data feeds," but listing.data's
    actual payload is the SUBJECT property's own facts (sqft, beds, baths
    - confirmed by reading Agent 05's send directly), not a pool of
    comparable OTHER properties. Wiring self.mls_feed into comp-building
    would mean using the listing's own facts as if they were market comps
    for itself - architecturally wrong, not a fix. Real comps require a
    genuine MLS comp-search capability that doesn't exist anywhere in this
    system; _build_comp_package currently (correctly, given what's
    actually available) processes whatever comps list the requester
    supplies directly, rather than pretending to have a search capability
    that isn't there.
