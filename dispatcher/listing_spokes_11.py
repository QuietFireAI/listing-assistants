class Spoke11ClientCommunication:
    """DECISIONS.md tuples implemented directly:
      1. reply mixes routine + advice -> answer neither, split and route
         both. Soft finding, not resolved here: the "split" is a label
         (split="routine_only") on the lead.reply sent to the owning
         agent, not an actual text extraction - the full raw message
         (including the advice portion) is what's forwarded. Real
         sentence-splitting would be invented NLP logic this review
         won't guess at; flagging rather than pretending it's done.
      2. client is angry -> acknowledge + escalation.complaint, no
         defensiveness, no promises. CONFLICT WITH THE RATIFIED PLAYBOOK,
         NOT RESOLVED HERE: checked playbooks/P14-complaint-response
         directly - its HITL gates say "No agent replies publicly or
         privately to the complaint - drafting is permitted, sending is
         human-only." This tuple's own text says to send an
         acknowledgment. These are in direct conflict for the same real
         event. Did not silently pick a side - left the existing
         acknowledgment send untouched, added P14's other requirement
         (the outbound hold, step 2) since that part doesn't touch the
         disputed question. Needs an owner decision: does the
         acknowledgment stay, or does P14's human-only reply rule win?
      3. two agents report conflicting statuses -> send nothing,
         clarification. Fixed 2026-07-16: the conflict-detection logic
         only ran for status.update - deadline.alert and
         client.message.request shared the same outer branch but had no
         equivalent check, despite the tuple being written generically
         and covering any of the three update types this agent receives.
      4. urgent alert inside quiet hours -> send only if config marks that
         class exempt, otherwise wake human not client
      5. 'what would you do?' -> escalation.legal_line, verbatim
      6. pricing/strategy question -> Legal Line, template ack + human handoff
      7. message would go out after legal contact hours -> queue for next
         window, urgency claim requires human override
      8. template variable unresolved -> does not send, blank-fill is
         fabrication
      9. client references an off-log conversation -> acknowledge + ask
         for particulars, never pretend recall
      10. negative-tone reply -> route P14 complaint intake, never
          freestyle de-escalation. Fixed 2026-07-16: this never actually
          escalated via escalation.complaint at all - it only tagged a
          lead.reply to the owning business agent, which has no
          relationship to P14's real mechanism. Checked the playbook
          directly (see tuple 2's note): step 1 is escalation.complaint
          verbatim, step 2 is the outbound hold. Both now real.
      11. contact-channel change request -> honor immediately, record via
          14, confirm once
