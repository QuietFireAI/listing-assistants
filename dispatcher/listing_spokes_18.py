class Spoke18CalendarTask:
    """DECISIONS.md tuples implemented directly:
      1. event conflict priority rules can't resolve -> human, never
         silently move either. Fixed 2026-07-16: only tuple 5's day-
         capacity check existed - two events at the exact same time on
         the same day would both silently get added with zero conflict
         signal. Now a real time-based conflict check, distinct from
         capacity.
      2. briefing item's source envelope missing -> state the gap. NOT
         implemented - generate_briefing() only aggregates what it has;
         there's no mechanism to know something is missing unless a
         separate system tells it to expect that item. Genuinely
         difficult without an "expected items" tracking layer this
         review won't invent.
      3. human instruction conflicts with contractual deadline -> surface
         both, act on neither until directed. NOT implemented - zero
         code, confirmed by grep. No payload key or handler exists for a
         distinct "human instruction" input at all.
      4. agent asks to move a protected deadline block -> refuse, human
         confirmation only
      5. overloaded day -> propose priority order, human confirms. Soft
         finding, not fixed: the message claims "proposing priority
         order" but no actual order is computed or attached - same
         decorative-claim pattern as Agents 04/06/09.
      6. two deadline sources disagree -> track both, alert the conflict,
         never pick the friendlier date
      7. owner calendar conflicts with contractual deadline -> deadline
         outranks, propose the move on the soft item
      8. recurring task silently failing (no completion events) -> surface
         the pattern, a quiet calendar is a suspect calendar. SERIOUS GAP
         found 2026-07-16: self.recurring_task_last_seen is never written
         by any real code path anywhere in this class - the existing test
         populated it by directly poking the internal dict
         (spoke.recurring_task_last_seen[...] = ...), not through any
         real message. In actual operation this dict is always empty, so
         check_recurring_task() can never fire - there is no mechanism
         anywhere in the swarm that signals "a recurring task completed."
         Needs a real design decision (what signal, from whom) this
         review won't invent.
      9. timezone ambiguity -> confirm before scheduling

    CRITICAL cross-agent bug found and fixed 2026-07-16, not a tuple:
    Agent 06's and Agent 09's calendar.event sends never included 'day'
    or 'timezone_confirmed' at all. This agent gates on tz_confirmed
    FIRST and keys its entire calendar on 'day' - meaning every single
    real showing confirmation (06) and vendor appointment (09) was
    getting caught at the timezone-ambiguity gate and NEVER reaching the
    calendar, ever. Verified directly: a real showing confirmation
    produced a clarification.request and left self.calendar completely
    empty. In production this agent's calendar, capacity checks, and
    protected-block tracking were all silently non-functional. Fixed in
    both senders.

    Plus: agent.status tracking - the actual fix for real-time HITL
    visibility into what's waiting on what, discussed and decided as a
    push-pattern extension matching how this agent already consumes
    calendar.event/deadline.alert, rather than a pull from 14 (18 has no
    route to query 14 at all, and a briefing "never contains a status the
    system cannot source" - so the signal has to be pushed here directly).
