    """Scores leads on readiness; assigns tier; routes hot/warm/dead.

    DECISIONS.md tuples implemented directly:
      1. score on a tier boundary -> lower tier assigned (not just noted),
         + flagged for human. Fixed 2026-07-16: the tier used to be
         computed via score>=threshold (the HIGHER tier), with a note
         appended claiming the lower tier was assigned - it wasn't. Now
         the lower tier is actually assigned before the note is written.
      2. rubric missing/unreadable -> halt, clarification. Fixed
         2026-07-16: previously only produced a silent interaction.log
         entry (tier=UNKNOWN); no clarification.request was ever sent, so
         nothing alerted a human that scoring was halted. A real
         clarification.request now fires for both this and tuple 12.
      3. lead demands a human -> hot path regardless of score
      4. stated urgency vs financing signals conflict -> financing wins,
         conflict logged
      5. tier oscillates a third time -> human review
      6. supplied rubric conflicts with a tuple -> tuple wins, conflict
         recorded verbatim, flagged - never silently picked. Fixed
         2026-07-17: tuple-governed behaviors (demands_human, agent_
         shopping) have no representation in the rubric schema - only
         REQUIRED_RUBRIC_KEYS are ever read, so an extra/unexpected key
         attempting to encode conflicting behavior was silently ignored
         before. Now flagged as a spec finding when it happens, not a
         silent no-op - the tuple still wins structurally either way.
      7. financing letter present but expired -> treated as no verification
      8. lead is an agent shopping for a client -> flagged, different track
      9. rubric update arrives unsigned -> N/A at this layer: the hub's own
         signature gate on config.update (an authority intent) means an
         unsigned rubric never reaches this handler at all; documented
         here as a defense-in-depth note, not re-implemented redundantly
      10. budget conflicts with pre-approval doc -> doc wins, logged
      11. re-score request on a context with an open escalation -> hold
      12. all rubric inputs unknown -> tier UNKNOWN, not COLD; now also
          sends clarification.request (see tuple 2)

    Not a tuple, but a real gap found and fixed 2026-07-16: a signed
    rubric missing any key _score() reads used to silently fall back to
    a hardcoded default (e.g. hot_threshold=70) - Job Component #6 says
    this agent applies the rubric, never authors or drifts it, and
    backfilling a threshold nobody actually specified is authoring. No
    tuple covers a partial rubric, so per the doctrine's own root rule
    it's now rejected outright (prior rubric stays active, or None),
    with a clarification.request naming exactly which keys are missing.
