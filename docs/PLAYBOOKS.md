# ListingAssistants Operational Playbooks (P01–P24)
### Standard Operating Procedures for the 21-Agent Governed Swarm

> ### ⚠️ CRITICAL FIDUCIARY NOTICE (FRONT AND CENTER)
> **DISPATCHER AGENTS AND LISTING AGENTS ARE FUNDAMENTALLY INCAPABLE OF PERFORMING FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS. IT IS NOT WIRED.**
> 
> * **Zero Financial Execution Wiring:** There is no payment SDK, no automated wire gateway, and no banking transfer execution path anywhere in this platform. The wiring does not exist.
> * **Sole Human Fiduciary Responsibility:** Under state real estate licensing laws and the REALTOR® Code of Ethics, fiduciary responsibility belongs 100% to the licensed broker-in-charge (Agent 00). Fiduciary duty is legally non-delegable and cannot be transferred to an AI agent.
> * **NEVER During Training Under Any Circumstances:** Under no circumstances—whether during broker onboarding, model training, prompt personalization, or local fine-tuning—is an agent ever permitted to handle financial authority. The user must maintain full fiduciary control. A user must NEVER attempt to delegate financial actions to an agent during training. Only after an agent has been formally deployed into production motion and has demonstrated repeated, verified proficiency in its assigned administrative tasks can an authorized human even release a held *text disclosure*—and even then, financial *execution* remains completely unwired.

This document indexes all 24 production playbooks governing the 21-member operations team.
One entry per playbook: trigger, agents deployed, and human-in-the-loop (HITL) gates.

## Playbook P01 - New Listing Onboarding

**Summary:** Swarm deployment playbook: signed listing agreement to live, marketed listing. Deploys agents 04, 05, 06, 09, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18 in three gated phases. Use when a new listing agreement is executed and the human authorizes go-to-market.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 04, 05, 06, 09, 11, 12, 13, 14, 17, 18

### Trigger
Signed listing agreement executed and human submits the authorized listing
package (property data + list price) as a SIGNED `listing.change.authorized`
envelope. Price is the human's fiduciary decision made before this playbook
starts; no step below produces or modifies it.

### HITL gates
- Any `content.verdict: flagged` (2e) → marketing path halts until licensed review.
- Any pricing question from any party at any step → `escalation.legal_line`.
- Photos reveal property-data conflicts (04's ambiguity rule) → human.
- Exempt-status marketing (office exclusive / delayed marketing) → requires the
  signed seller disclosure on file BEFORE any 12 activity; otherwise 3b waits
  for 3a. No exceptions; local MLS rules are config.

## Playbook P02 - Price Adjustment

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: human-decided price change to updated, re-marketed listing. Agents 04, 05, 10, 11, 12, 17. Use when the human has decided (or is deciding) a list price change.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 04, 05, 10, 11, 12, 14, 17

### Trigger
Human requests decision-support data, or submits a SIGNED `listing.change.authorized` envelope with the new price. The price decision itself is fiduciary and human-only; this playbook surrounds it, never makes it.

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P03 - Under-Contract Transition

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: accepted offer to transaction-mode operations. Agents 05, 07, 08, 11, 12. Use when an offer is accepted and the listing moves to pending.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 05, 07, 08, 11, 12, 14, 18

### Trigger
Human confirms offer acceptance (executed contract artifact filed via 08).

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P04 - Open House Cycle

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: scheduled open house from promotion through lead capture. Agents 01, 02, 04, 06, 11, 12, 14, 17. Use when human/config schedules an open house.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 01, 02, 04, 06, 11, 12, 17

### Trigger

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P05 - Expired/Withdrawn Wind-down

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: immediate marketing halt and clean wind-down on expired or withdrawn listing. Agents 05, 11, 12, 14. Use when a listing expires or the seller withdraws.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 01, 05, 11, 12, 14

### Trigger
Listing reaches expiration date (07/05 tracked) or seller withdrawal confirmed by human.

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P06 - New Buyer Onboarding

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: signed buyer agreement to active matched-search. Agents 10, 11, 13, 14. Use when a written buyer agreement is executed. Hard-stops without the agreement.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 10, 11, 13, 14, 17

### Trigger
Signed written buyer agreement filed (08) and recorded (14).

### HITL gates

## Playbook P07 - Tour Day Coordination

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: client showing interest to completed, feedback-logged tour. Agents 06, 11, 13, 14, 18. Use when a buyer wants to see one or more properties.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 06, 11, 13, 14, 18

### Trigger

## Playbook P08 - Offer-to-Acceptance

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: offer submission through human-negotiated resolution. Agents 07, 08, 11, 18. Thinnest playbook by design - negotiation is entirely human; agents track status and documents around it.

### Trigger
Offer submitted (buyer-side or received on a listing).

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P09 - Contract-to-Close

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: executed contract through closing day. Agents 07, 08, 09, 11, 18. The densest sequential playbook - deadline-driven, wire-fraud lines active throughout.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 07, 08, 09, 11, 15, 18

**Agents touched (from step tables):** 11, 14, 17, 20

### Trigger

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P15 - CMA / Listing-Appointment Prep

**Agents touched (from step tables):** 10, 18

### Trigger
Listing appointment scheduled (human).

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P16 - Morning Operations

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: the realtor's morning brief. Calendar, overnight leads, market scrapes, prospect suggestions, and yesterday's books - assembled and presented for human review before the day starts. Agents 10, 14, 15, 18, 19.

### Trigger
Scheduled daily start (owner-configured time) or owner command.

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P17 - End-of-Day Books

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: close the day's books. Every interaction, lead movement, financial delta, and missed-item candidate captured to a dated dataset that feeds tomorrow's P16 brief. Agents 14, 15, 18.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 00, 14, 15, 18

### Trigger
Scheduled daily close (owner-configured) or owner command.

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P18 - Seller Weekly Report

**Agents touched (from step tables):** 05, 06, 10, 11, 17

### Trigger
Weekly per active listing (owner-configured day) or owner command.

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P19 - Property Access Custody

**Agents touched (from step tables):** 00, 06, 09, 14, 18

### Trigger
New listing access setup (from P01), custody audit cadence, or a custody event (lost key, code exposure, vendor access need).

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P20 - Vacant Property Watch

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: standing watch on vacant listings. Condition checks scheduled, utility status tracked, activity anomalies surfaced. Agents 05, 09, 10, 14, 18.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 00, 09, 10, 14, 18

### Trigger
Listing marked vacant (from P01 data or status change) until occupied/closed.

### HITL gates
(none listed beyond swarm-wide gates)

## Playbook P21 - Lead Re-Score Cycle

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: standing re-score of nurtured leads so a warming lead is promoted back into the SLA path before it goes cold. Agents 02, 03, 10, 14, 17. The long-tail companion to P11 - P11 catches the lead, P21 keeps re-reading it.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 02, 03, 10, 17

### Trigger
Date-driven cadence over the nurture pool (owner-configured interval) or an
owner command. P11 routes a WARM/COLD lead into nurture (`lead.nurture`, 02→03);
P21 is what periodically re-reads that lead instead of letting it sit.

### HITL gates
- A re-score that crosses into HOT with a legal/complaint signal on the context
  → `escalation.legal_line`, not an automated promotion.
- Any `content.verdict` flag on re-engagement copy → outbound holds until
  licensed review; the re-score itself still stands.
- A consent state that changed to withdrawn since P11 → no touch, no promotion;
  annotate 14 and stop for that lead.

## Playbook P22 - Buyer Feedback & Match Refresh

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: turn post-tour feedback into a refreshed buyer match set and the next round of showings. Agents 06, 10, 11, 13, 14. The iterative loop that P07 (single tour day) feeds into.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 06, 10, 11, 13, 14, 17

### Trigger
A completed tour with logged feedback (P07 completion), or an owner command to
re-run a buyer's match. P07 coordinates one tour day; P22 is what closes the
loop - feedback in, a sharper match set and next showings out.

### HITL gates
- Any `content.verdict` flag - especially a fair-housing / steering concern on
  match commentary (17's line) → outbound holds until licensed review.
- Feedback that reads as a discriminatory preference → 17 line first; the swarm
  never encodes it into criteria. Straight to human.
- Buyer signals intent to write an offer → this loop ends; P08 takes over.

## Playbook P23 - Price-Review Evidence Assembly

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: assemble the market-and-activity evidence for a price conversation and hand it to the human - who decides. Agents 05, 10, 11, 14, 15. Distinct from P02 (executes a decided change) and P15 (pre-listing CMA); this is the 'is it time to talk price' evidence pack for a live listing.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 05, 10, 11, 14, 15

### Trigger
A price-review signal on a live listing: days-on-market threshold crossed,
showing-to-offer ratio below a configured floor, or an owner command. This
playbook produces evidence; it never produces or implies a number. The price
opinion is the human's fiduciary decision, always - the same line P02 and P15
hold.

### HITL gates
- The playbook states NO recommended price and NO "should reduce" language. Any
  drafted output that does → held before it reaches the human; the assembly is
  evidence, not advice.
- Any pricing question routed in from another party at any point →
  `escalation.legal_line`, never answered by the swarm.
- If the human decides to adjust → this playbook ends and P02 (price adjustment)
  begins on the human's signed change. P23 never crosses into execution.

## Playbook P24 - Prospecting Outreach

**Summary:** Swarm deployment: agent 19 surfaces prospecting opportunities (FSBO, expired, farm signals) under a HITL-per-case probation gate. Agents 10, 13, 14, 19 (probation, legal today); adds 11, 17 at graduation (requires ratified tuples). Every case pauses for human validation until the agent has logged reps and its working limits are known.
**Agents touched (from step tables):** 10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 19

### Trigger
A prospecting signal for agent 19: a date-driven scrape cadence over the
configured farm/FSBO/expired sources, or an owner command. Sources are config;
this playbook never widens them on its own.

### HITL gates
- Probation: **every** case is a HITL stop (Phase P2). This is the whole point.
- Any prospect on a suppression/DNC/opt-out list → not surfaced for outreach at
  all; recorded and dropped. No human override of a suppression record.
- Any Article-16 targeted-solicitation concern (contacting a prospect whose
  listing is with another broker) → `escalation.legal_line`, never an
  automated touch, in probation OR graduation.
- Graduation is a two-key action: reps-on-log AND owner ratification. One
  without the other keeps the agent in probation.
