# Push Log

Every commit pushed to the four in-scope repos, in chronological order.
Created 2026-07-17 per direct instruction, after a legitimate question
about whether pushes were actually landing when claimed. Existing history
below was reconstructed retroactively from each repo's real `git log`
output (timestamps and hashes are actual commit metadata, not
reconstructed from memory). Going forward, a new row is added to this
file in the SAME commit that makes the change it describes - not
after the fact, not in a separate pass.

**Repos in scope:** `listing-agents`, `listing-agents-blueprint`,
`dispatcher-agents`, `dispatcher-agents-blueprint`. No other repos
(freight-agents, freight-agents-blueprint, the six pillar packages)
are tracked here - those are explicitly out of scope per direct
instruction.

**How to verify any row yourself:** `git clone` the repo, `git log
--format="%H %ai %s"`, and confirm the hash/timestamp/message match.
Don't take this file's word for it - that's the whole point of it
existing.
